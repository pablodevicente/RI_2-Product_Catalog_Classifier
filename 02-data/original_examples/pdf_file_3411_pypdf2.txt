1. Switch bodyHigh precision micro limit switches with excellent environment proofing
Quickly upgraded to limit switches with lamps by mounting an LED lamp socket
FEATURES
1. Subminiature design
The size of the actual unit is approxi-mately 1/10 in the case of the plungermodel and approximately 1/6.5 in thecase of the arm model, that of the verti-cal type limit switch.Large-scale miniaturization has beenachieved. Ideal for miniaturized machin-ery designs or highly accurate miniatur-ized machines.
2. A lamp can be easily added for
operations checksAn exposed terminal type model com-
bined with a socket with cord for thebuilt-in LED lamp (sold separately) easilybecome a limit switch with lamp.Convenient for maintenance such asoperations checks.
3. With appropriate O.T. range display
The arm model has a convenient appro-priate O.T. range display for attachmentadjustment work. This should be set sothat the operations display board’s indi-cated protrusion winds inside the protru-sion on the axle receptor, permitting useunder optimum conditions.
4. Terminal uses both solder and tab
(#110)
5. O.P. accuracy of ±0.2 (O.P. repeated
accuracy initially ±0.03) achieved
Attachment accuracy improved greatly
The plunger model has achieved a highO.P. repeated accuracy of within0.03mm through the development of aunique switch mechanism and a stan-dard attachment surface on the uppersurface of the unit (a surface with noslants.)Also, through a unique mechanism thatpermits adjustment of the O.P. in eachindividual product at the time of assem-bly, an O.P. accuracy of ±0.2mm.008inch can be safeguarded between
lots, so that almost no operating positionadjustment is required during eitherattachment or replacement.6. A subminiature limit switch with a
great stroke margin (O.T./T.T.)
The T.T. has been enlarged by using aswitching mechanism by coil spring forQL.7. Long lifeThe unit has a long mechanical life ofminimum 10
7times and a long electrical
life of min. 3 /H11503105times (5A, 250V AC
resistance load) by means of a silveralloy contact with excellent solvent-proofcharacteristics and a guaranteed wipingoperation that possesses two hinges andswitching method by coil spring.8. A mechanism with excellent envi-ronment proofing• A protective construction equivalent toIEC IP64The actuator has an axle seal with spe-cial packing, and the main case and ter-minals have both a waterproof ring andan epoxy-sealed mechanism. Also, theentire mechanism is water-proof due tothe optional socket.
Socket with cord type... IP64 equivalent
• A sturdy, shockproof constructionThe body uses die-cast zinc, and theactuator uses stainless steel. Moreover,shock absorbers have been added tolessen the shock during plunger release.
TYPICAL APPLICATIONS
Any application where compactness,density, and robustness, such as sub-miniaturized machines and plant machin-ery, is required.

1. L socket type
1) After loosening the L socket fasteningscrews, grasp the terminal cover and pullit away from the switch body.2) Remove the fastening screw from the
terminal block. (Remove with the 3 termi-nal receptacle.)
3) Loosen the hexagonal nut and
remove the rubber bushing and washerfrom the inside.
4) Select cord from applicable wire table.
5) Decide which direction the cord outletis to face and strip the sheath according-ly. (See page 43.)6) After passing the applicable cordthrough the hexagonal nut, bushing, andwasher in that order, pass the cordthrough the terminal case.
7) After stripping the cord sheath, insert
the corresponding wires into the groovesof the terminal body up to the wire stop,then crimp the terminal receptacle overthe wires with a pair of pliers.8) After the terminals have been properlycrimped in the terminal body, insert thebody into the terminal case. (Wheninserting the body, be careful not to blockthe hole for the fastening screw with thewires.)
9) Temporarily screw in the fastening
screw through the terminal body, theninsert the washer and rubber bushinginto the cord opening of L socket.Tighten it with a wrench or pliers.
10) Apply the rubber packing over the
terminals, then insert the L socket intothe switch body.
11) Tighten the fastening screw into the
switch body.2. Socket with cord (including socket
with lamp)
1) Apply the rubber packing over the ter-minals, then insert the socket with cordinto the switch body.
2) Screw the socket fastening screw into
the switch body and tighten it.
Mounting
The QL micro limit switch is manufac-tured with a very small variation in thedistance between the datum plane andthe operating point. When the operatingpoint has been accurately establishedand the mounting position clearly deter-mined, two M4 bolts should be usedsecurely fastening the switch.

1. Ambient conditions
1) The use of these switches under thefollowing conditions should be avoided. Ifthe following conditions should becomenecessary, we recommend consulting usfirst.• Use where there will be direct contact
with organic solvents, strong acids oralkalis, or direct exposure to theirvapors.
• Use where inflammable or corrosive
gases exist.
2) Because these switchies are not ofwater resistant or immersion-proof con-struction, their use in water or oil shouldbe avoided. Also, locations where wateror oil can normally impringe upon theswitch or where there is an excessiveaccumulation of dust should be avoided.2. Wiring1) Although QL limit switches have largeover-travel (O.T.), excessive O.T. willoccur wear and change in its characteris-tics. Specifically, where there is a needfor long life, it is recommended that theproper O.T. should be used.When the operating object is in the freecondition, force should not be applieddirectly to the actuator.2) Use their own accessories whenmounting and wiring QL limit switches soas to maintain their own characterisrics.3) In order to maintain the reliability at ahigh level under practical conditions ofuse, the actual operating conditionsshould be checked for the benefit of thequality of the product.4) Do not use the switch in a siliconatmosphere. Case should be takenwhere organic silicon rubber, adhesive,sealing material, oil, grease or lead wiregenerates silicon.5) Avoid use in excessively dusty envi-ronments where actuator operationwould be hindered.3. Socket with LED1) The OFF condition leakage current ateach voltage is as follows.
2) Even the polarity of power source is
connected in the opposite way, LED isnot broken. However, LED is not lit on.
