PRODUCT TYPE
1. Switch body
High precision micro limit switches with excellent environment proofing
Quickly upgraded to limit switches with lamps by mounting an LED lamp socket
FEATURES
1. Subminiature design
The size of the actual unit is approxi-
mately 1/10 in the case of the plunger
model and approximately 1/6.5 in the
case of the arm model, that of the verti-
cal type limit switch.
Large-scale miniaturization has been
achieved. Ideal for miniaturized machin-
ery designs or highly accurate miniatur-
ized machines.
2. A lamp can be easily added for
operations checks
An exposed terminal type model com-
bined with a socket with cord for the
built-in LED lamp (sold separately) easily
become a limit switch with lamp.
Convenient for maintenance such as
operations checks.
3. With appropriate O.T. range display
The arm model has a convenient appro-
priate O.T. range display for attachment
adjustment work. This should be set so
that the operations display board’s indi-
cated protrusion winds inside the protru-
sion on the axle receptor, permitting use
under optimum conditions.
4. Terminal uses both solder and tab
(#110)
5. O.P. accuracy of ±0.2 (O.P. repeated
accuracy initially ±0.03) achieved
Attachment accuracy improved greatly
The plunger model has achieved a high
O.P. repeated accuracy of within
0.03mm through the development of a
unique switch mechanism and a stan-
dard attachment surface on the upper
surface of the unit (a surface with no
slants.)
Also, through a unique mechanism that
permits adjustment of the O.P. in each
individual product at the time of assem-
bly, an O.P. accuracy of ±0.2mm
.008inch can be safeguarded between
lots, so that almost no operating position
adjustment is required during either
attachment or replacement.
6. A subminiature limit switch with a
great stroke margin (O.T./T.T.)
The T.T. has been enlarged by using a
switching mechanism by coil spring for
QL.
7. Long life
The unit has a long mechanical life of
minimum 107 times and a long electrical
life of min. 3  105 times (5A, 250V AC
resistance load) by means of a silver
alloy contact with excellent solvent-proof
characteristics and a guaranteed wiping
operation that possesses two hinges and
switching method by coil spring.
8. A mechanism with excellent envi-
ronment proofing
• A protective construction equivalent to
IEC IP64
The actuator has an axle seal with spe-
cial packing, and the main case and ter-
minals have both a waterproof ring and
an epoxy-sealed mechanism. Also, the
entire mechanism is water-proof due to
the optional socket.
Socket with cord type... IP64 equivalent
• A sturdy, shockproof construction
The body uses die-cast zinc, and the
actuator uses stainless steel. Moreover,
shock absorbers have been added to
lessen the shock during plunger release.
TYPICAL APPLICATIONS
Any application where compactness,
density, and robustness, such as sub-
miniaturized machines and plant machin-
ery, is required.

Notes)
1. Cadmium free contact types are available on a custom-made basis. Please add an “F” to the end of the part number when ordering.
2. *L socket type or socket with cord type is combination of;
L socket type = Exposed terminal type + L socket, Socket with cord type = Exposed terminal type + Socket with cord type (cord length: 1m)
3. UL recognized, CSA certified type available. When ordering, add suffix 9 to part No..
(For the socket with cord type, only UL recognized type available with suffix 9 to the part No.)

Notes)
1. Keep possible leakage current (see the CAUTIONS)
in mind in order to prevent the load from malfunc-
tioning.
2. Types with the 24 to 48V DC lamp rating are recom-
mended for sequencer input use.
3. Connect the red and black leads to the positive B
and negative v terminals, respectively, for the N.C.
type, and the white and black leads to the positive
B and negative v terminals, respectively, for the
N.O. type.

MOUNTING METHOD
1. L socket type
1) After loosening the L socket fastening
screws, grasp the terminal cover and pull
it away from the switch body.
2) Remove the fastening screw from the
terminal block. (Remove with the 3 termi-
nal receptacle.)
3) Loosen the hexagonal nut and
remove the rubber bushing and washer
from the inside.
4) Select cord from applicable wire table.
5) Decide which direction the cord outlet
is to face and strip the sheath according-
ly. (See page 43.)
6) After passing the applicable cord
through the hexagonal nut, bushing, and
washer in that order, pass the cord
through the terminal case.
7) After stripping the cord sheath, insert
the corresponding wires into the grooves
of the terminal body up to the wire stop,
then crimp the terminal receptacle over
the wires with a pair of pliers.
8) After the terminals have been properly
crimped in the terminal body, insert the
body into the terminal case. (When
inserting the body, be careful not to block
the hole for the fastening screw with the
wires.)
9) Temporarily screw in the fastening
screw through the terminal body, then
insert the washer and rubber bushing
into the cord opening of L socket.
Tighten it with a wrench or pliers.
10) Apply the rubber packing over the
terminals, then insert the L socket into
the switch body.
11) Tighten the fastening screw into the
switch body.
2. Socket with cord (including socket
with lamp)
1) Apply the rubber packing over the ter-
minals, then insert the socket with cord
into the switch body.
2) Screw the socket fastening screw into
the switch body and tighten it.
Mounting
The QL micro limit switch is manufac-
tured with a very small variation in the
distance between the datum plane and
the operating point. When the operating
point has been accurately established
and the mounting position clearly deter-
mined, two M4 bolts should be used
securely fastening the switch.
Pull away from the body.
Turn counterclockwise.

1. Ambient conditions
1) The use of these switches under the
following conditions should be avoided. If
the following conditions should become
necessary, we recommend consulting us
first.
• Use where there will be direct contact
with organic solvents, strong acids or
alkalis, or direct exposure to their
vapors.
• Use where inflammable or corrosive
gases exist.
2) Because these switchies are not of
water resistant or immersion-proof con-
struction, their use in water or oil should
be avoided. Also, locations where water
or oil can normally impringe upon the
switch or where there is an excessive
accumulation of dust should be avoided.
2. Wiring
1) Although QL limit switches have large
over-travel (O.T.), excessive O.T. will
occur wear and change in its characteris-
tics. Specifically, where there is a need
for long life, it is recommended that the
proper O.T. should be used.
When the operating object is in the free
condition, force should not be applied
directly to the actuator.
2) Use their own accessories when
mounting and wiring QL limit switches so
as to maintain their own characterisrics.
3) In order to maintain the reliability at a
high level under practical conditions of
use, the actual operating conditions
should be checked for the benefit of the
quality of the product.
4) Do not use the switch in a silicon
atmosphere. Case should be taken
where organic silicon rubber, adhesive,
sealing material, oil, grease or lead wire
generates silicon.
5) Avoid use in excessively dusty envi-
ronments where actuator operation
would be hindered.
3. Socket with LED
1) The OFF condition leakage current at
each voltage is as follows.
2) Even the polarity of power source is
connected in the opposite way, LED is
not broken. However, LED is not lit on.
