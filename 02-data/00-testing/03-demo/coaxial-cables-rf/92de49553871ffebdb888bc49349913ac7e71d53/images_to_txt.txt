* The cable itself is a copper conductor with a diameter of approximately 1 mm.
* The cable has a braided shield made of copper wires, which provides electromagnetic interference (EMI) protection.
* The cable has a polyethylene (PE) insulation layer, which provides electrical insulation and protects the conductor from environmental factors.
