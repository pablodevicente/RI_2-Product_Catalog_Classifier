Features:
The AMM-3538-B analog MEMS microphone features a specialized pre-
amplification ASIC that provides high sensitivity and high SNR output from a
capacitive audio sensor. It’s packaged for surface mounting and high
temperature reflow assembly.
• -38dB sensitivity
• 65dB Signal-to-Noise
• Analog output
• Small 3.5mm x 2.65mm surface-mount package

Recommended Reflow Soldering Procedure
(Recommended profile,
temperature ≤ 260°C, 30s maximum at peak temperature)
Important notes to minimize device damage
1. Do not handle the microphone with pick-and-place vacuum tools that could
contact the microphone acoustic port hole.
2. Never expose the microphone’s acoustic port hole to vacuum. Such exposure
can damage or destroy the MEMS element.
3. Never allow air to blow air into the microphone acoustic port hole. The port
hole must be sealed to prevent particle contamination if a blown air-cleaning
process is used,
4. A clean room environment is recommended for PCB assembly to avoid
microphone contamination.
5. Do not use blown air or ultrasonic cleaning procedures on MEMS Microphones.
A no-clean paste is recommended for the assembly, avoiding subsequent
cleaning steps. cleaning substances can severely damage the microphone
MEMS element.
6. it is recommended to cover the sound port with protective tape during PCB
sawing or system assembly. This prevents blocking or partially blocking the
acoustic port hole during PCB assembly.
7. Do not use excessive force to place the microphone on the PCB. Use industry
standard pick and place tools to limit the mechanical force exerted on the
package.
