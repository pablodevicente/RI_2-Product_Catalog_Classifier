Recommended Reflow Soldering Procedure (Recommended profile,
temperature ≤ 260°C, 30s maximum at peak temperature.)
Important notes to minimize device damage:
1. Do not handle the microphone with pick-and-place vacuum tools that could contact
the microphone acoustic port hole.
2. Never expose the microphone’s acoustic port hole to vacuum. Such exposure can
damage or destroy the MEMS element.
3. Never allow air to blow air into the microphone acoustic port hole. The port hole must
be sealed to prevent particle contamination if a blown air-cleaning process is used,
4. A clean room environment is recommended for PCB assembly to avoid microphone
contamination.
5. Do not use blown air or ultrasonic cleaning procedures on MEMS Microphones. A no-
clean paste is recommended for the assembly, avoiding subsequent cleaning steps.
cleaning substances can severely damage the microphone MEMS element.
6. it is recommended to cover the sound port with protective tape during PCB sawing or
system assembly. This prevents blocking or partially blocking the acoustic port hole
during PCB assembly.
7. Do not use excessive force to place the microphone on the PCB. Use industry
standard pick and place tools to limit the mechanical force exerted on the package.
