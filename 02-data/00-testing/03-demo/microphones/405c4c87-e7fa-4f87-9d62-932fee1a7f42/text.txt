Data Sheet PNM-3546L-C3310-R
PUI Audio’s noise-canceling microphones are designed with dipole inlets on the
back of the microphone capsule to reduce background noise from wind and the
road for the clearest possible pickup of a user’s voice—especially when used in
automotive applications.
The frequency response of the microphone is exceptionally flat when placed
2.54cm from the acoustic source, but rolls-off at 2 to 5 dB/octave when placed
50cm away from the acoustic source.
Features:
• 6mm diameter
• 3.5mm height
• -46 dB sensitivity @ 50cm
• >55 dB signal-to-noise ratio
• Reduces the effect of wind and road noise
• Integrated 33pF and 10pF buzz-blocking capacitors reduce GSM noise

Microphone Handling Precautions
High temperature and/or static electricity may damage microphones. To ensure careful handling, we
suggest following these precautions:
• Ensure the power rating of the soldering iron is below 90 watts
• The temperature of the soldering iron must be limited to 360°C ±10°C (680°F ±50°F)
• Soldering duration for each terminal shall be at or under 2 seconds
• If practical, use a metal fixture to hold the microphone in-place and to act as a heatsink. A fixture
should have appropriate diameter holes drilled through the entire fixture to prevent pressure from
being placed on the diaphragm (as below)
