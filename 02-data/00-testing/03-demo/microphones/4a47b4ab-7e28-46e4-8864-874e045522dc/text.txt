Data Sheet AUM-5241L-HD
PUI Audio’s all-new HD Series microphones use premium-grade MOSFETs and diaphragms
for high sensitivity and superior signal-to-noise ratio. Each microphone features GSM buzz-
blocking capacitors. Upgrade the ECM microphone that you use today with a PUI Audio
HD Series microphone.
The 14mm diameter AUM-5241L-HD ECM is a back-electret cardioid/uni-directional
microphone designed for extreme fidelity and focused recording of acoustic sources
directly on-axis with the face of the microphone.
Features:
• -41dB sensitivity
• 74dB signal-to-noise ratio
• Cardioid pickup pattern
• 14mm diameter
• 5.2mm height

Microphone Handling Precautions
High temperature and/or static electricity may damage microphones. To ensure careful
handling, we suggest following these precautions:
• Ensure the power rating of the soldering iron is below 90 watts
• The temperature of the soldering iron must be limited to 360°C ±10°C (680°F ±50°F)
• Soldering duration for each terminal shall be at or under 2 seconds
• Avoid the rear sound holes when soldering
• If practical, use a metal fixture to hold the microphone in-place and to act as a
heatsink. A fixture should have appropriate diameter holes drilled through the entire
fixture to prevent pressure from being placed on the diaphragm (as below)
