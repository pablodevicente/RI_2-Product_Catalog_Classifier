Recommended Soldering Procedure
Reliability Testing
Type of Test Test Specifications
Samples for qualification testing require 3 passes 260±5 ℃ reflow
Simulated Reflow solder profiles. 2 hours of setting time is required between each
(Without Solder) reflow profile test.
Precondition at +25℃ for 1 hour. Expose to +85℃ with 85%
relative humidity for 1000 hours. Finally, dry at room ambient for
Static Humidity 3±1 hour before taking final measurement.
Each cycle shall consist of 30 minutes at -40℃, 30 minutes at
+125℃ with 5 minutes transition time. Test duration is for 30
Temperature Shock cycles, starting from cold to hot temperature.
Perform ESD sensitivity threshold measurements for each contact
according to MIL-STD-883G, Method 3015.7 for Human Body
Model. Identify the ESD threshold levels indicating passage of
ESD Sensitivity 8000V Human Body Model.
Vibrate randomly along three perpendicular directions for 30
minutes in each direction, 4 cycles from 20~2000 Hz with a peak
Vibration Test acceleration of 20 Gs.
Subject samples to half-sine shock pulses (3000±15% Gs for
Shock Test 0.3ms) in each direction, for a total of 18 shocks.
Drop samples from 1.5m height onto a steel surface, total 18
Drop Test times and inspected for mechanical damage.
Subject samples to +125℃ for 168 hours under full maximum
Operation Life rated voltage.
Place 15 microphones in water at 1m depth for 30 minutes.
Remove and dissect 5 pieces to check for water ingress. Test
remaining 10 microphones for sensitivity after resting at room
Waterproof Test temperature for 2 hours.
Microphone frequency response and sensitivity shall not deviate more than ±3 dB.
