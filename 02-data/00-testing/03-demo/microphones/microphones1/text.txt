Typical Frequency Response
Recommended Soldering Procedure
Recommend reflow profile, solder reflow <=260℃ (for 30s Max of peak temperature)
Important Notes In order to minimize device damage:
1. Times of reflow ≤3
2. Pressure relief hole can’t be covered.
3. Pressure relief hole can’t be blown by strong wind.
4. Do not wash or clean the boards after the reflow process.
5. In the process of reflux, there can be no atomizing solvent or liquid
