The image depicts a magnified view of a microchip or integrated circuit. The following elements are visible :

1. **Dielectric layer** : A thin layer of insulating material (dielectric) is visible as a dark, uniform background. This layer separates the conductive layers and prevents electrical shorts.
2. **Conductive layers** : Thin layers of conductive material, such as copper or aluminum, are visible as lighter, textured areas. These layers are responsible for carrying electrical signals.
3. **Metalization** : A pattern of metal lines and pads is visible, indicating the presence of metalization. This process involves depositing metal onto the dielectric layer to create conductive paths.
4. **Passivation** : A thin layer of passivation material is visible, covering the metalization. This layer protects the metal from corrosion and ensures reliable electrical performance.
5. **Bonding pads** : Small, rounded areas are visible, indicating the presence of bonding pads. These pads provide
