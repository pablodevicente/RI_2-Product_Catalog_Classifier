 description of dataframe rows

row 0
 hexagonal locknut a type of fastener characterized by its hexagonal shape which allows for easy installation and removal using a wrench this component is designed to provide a secure fit by locking against the threads of the bolt or stud it engages with often used in applications requiring high torque retention

row 1
 internal thread refers to a threading feature found within a cylindrical or tubular component that allows for the engagement with external threads such as those on bolts or screws internal threads are commonly found in nuts washers and other fastening devices facilitating a secure connection between parts
row 0 of the dataframe contains a single entry under the properties column which is temperature range this property indicates the span or interval over which temperature values vary typically expressed in degrees eg celsius or fahrenheit the temperature range can be used to describe the thermal conditions within a specific environment or system such as the operational temperature limits of a device the climate conditions in a geographical area or the temperature fluctuations observed over a given period
the provided dataframe contains four rows and one column each row representing different pipe thread specifications here is a detailed technical description for each row

1 row 0 this row describes an npt national pipe thread fitting with a nominal size of 38 inch the thread size is 22 indicating the number of threads per inch the body diameter is 6 mm the depth of the threads is 5 mm and the maximum pressure rating is 100 psi the material and finish are specified as panptswg which likely indicates a specific type of plastic or alloy with a particular surface treatment

2 row 1 this row details an npt fitting with a nominal size of 12 inch it has 27 threads per inch a body diameter of 6 mm a thread depth of 6 mm and a maximum pressure rating of 100 psi the material and finish are again specified as panptswg

3 row 2 this row pertains to an npt fitting with a nominal size of 34 inch the thread size is 36 indicating 36 threads per inch the body diameter is 7 mm the thread depth is 7 mm and the maximum pressure rating is 100 psi the material and finish are specified as panptswg

4 row 3 this row describes an npt fitting with a nominal size of 1 inch the thread size is 42 indicating 42 threads per inch the body diameter is 7 mm the thread depth is 7 mm and the maximum pressure rating is 100 psi the material and finish are specified as panptswg
the provided dataframe consists of a single column labeled a and four rows indexed at 0 1 2 and 3 each row contains detailed information about pipe thread specifications and additional parameters
