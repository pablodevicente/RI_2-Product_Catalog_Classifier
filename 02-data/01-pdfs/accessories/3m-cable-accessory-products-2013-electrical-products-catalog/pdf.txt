overhead conductor animal guard cover
3m conductor covers cci series are extruded silicone rubber tubes designed for field installation over
bare conductors to insulate them from adjacent phasesgrounded equipmentand animal contactthese
covers are made with a fulllength longitudinal bias cut to allow for easy slipon installationand provide
an increased creepage distance between the conductor and the outer surface of the cover
the covers are offered in two thickness sizes for covering both 15 kv and 25 kv rated conductorsand are
available in acsr conductor sizes from 2 awg266 kcmil
