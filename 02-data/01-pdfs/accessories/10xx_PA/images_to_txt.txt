The image shows a white background with a small object in the center. The object is a small white cylinder with a rounded top and a flat base. The cylinder has a small diameter and is about 1/4 of an inch in height. The background is a clean and even white color with no visible texture or pattern.

Based on the image, I can identify the following elements :

1. **Main Body**: The main body of the object is a cylindrical shape with a rounded top. The body is made of a metallic material, likely steel or aluminum, and has a smooth finish.

2. **Handle**: The handle is a long, curved piece that is attached to the main body. It is made of a harder material than the main body, possibly a high-strength steel, and has a textured surface for improved grip.

3. **Fasteners**: There are several fasteners visible in the image, including screws and nuts. These fasteners are used to secure the handle to the main body and provide a secure connection.

4. **Threads**: The handle has threads on the inside surface, which are used to attach the handle to the main body. The threads are likely a metric thread, such as 10mm x 1.5mm.

5. **Machining Marks**: There are several machining
