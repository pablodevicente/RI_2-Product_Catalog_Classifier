### Technical Description of the Dataframe

The provided dataframe consists of a single column named "Item" and two rows indexed at 0 and 1. Each row contains a specific item description as follows:

- **Row 0:**
  - **Item:** Screw plug
  - **Description:** A screw plug is a type of fastener designed to seal openings in surfaces such as walls or floors. It typically consists of a threaded shank that screws into a tapped hole, providing a secure and watertight seal. The plug is often made from materials like plastic, metal, or composite materials, depending on the application requirements.

- **Row 1:**
  - **Item:** Connecting thread
  - **Description:** A connecting thread refers to a type of screw thread used to join or connect two parts together. This thread design facilitates the assembly and disassembly of components, allowing for a secure and adjustable connection. Connecting threads can be found in various applications, including mechanical assemblies, electrical connectors, and plumbing systems. They are characterized by their precise pitch and thread profile, ensuring reliable performance under different loads and environmental conditions.
### Technical Description

**Row 0: Properties - Temperature Range**
- **Description:** This property specifies the operational temperature range within which the device or system can function without degradation of performance or reliability.
- **Units:** Typically measured in degrees Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F).
- **Significance:** Ensures that the equipment operates safely and effectively under varying environmental conditions.

**Row 1: Properties - Protection Grade**
- **Description:** This property indicates the level of protection provided by the device against external factors such as dust, water, and mechanical impacts.
- **Units:** Defined using an internationally recognized standard (e.g., IP rating).
- **Significance:** Helps in determining the suitability of the device for use in harsh environments where exposure to elements is likely.
