### Rated Control Voltage
The table lists the rated control voltages for the device, specifying three different voltage types: AC and DC. The device is designed to operate under two different AC voltage ratings—125V AC and 250V AC—and one DC voltage rating of 30V DC.

### Resistive Load (cos φ = 1)
For resistive loads where the power factor (cos φ) is 1, the table indicates that the maximum current capacity is 5A. This applies to all three voltage types: 125V AC, 250V AC, and 30V DC. A power factor of 1 means that the load is purely resistive, with no reactive component, ensuring that the current and voltage are in phase.

### Inductive Load (cos φ = 0.4)
When dealing with inductive loads where the power factor (cos φ) is 0.4, the maximum current capacity drops to 3A for all three voltage types: 125V AC, 250V AC, and 30V DC. An inductive load introduces a phase shift between the current and voltage, reducing the effective current-carrying capability compared to resistive loads.
