For obvious reasons i can not include the hole database here. I've left some examples and the important files (classifier data training and so on)

in 01-pdfs you can find a processed example of accesories class

i've also included some more complete classes, you test the classifiers amognst them

this classes are inside the 00-testing folder, and are more intended to be played around with than take as a fully processed version

you can find the URLS for digikeys download in 01-pdfs/Digikeys download. More information in 01-code/0_Download_pdfs
